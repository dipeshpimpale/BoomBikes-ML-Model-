## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
For US bike-sharing firm BoomBikes, the project intends to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. Based on a few criteria, the information gives daily bike demands for the American market. Utilising the model, business strategy will be modified as needed to meet demand levels and fulfil customer expectations.

- What is the background of your project?
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing business, is attempting to understand how the Covid-19 epidemic has changed the level of demand for leased bikes in the US market. To help management change the business strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations, the project comprises creating a model to anticipate demand for shared bikes using available independent criteria. The 'cnt' variable should be used as the target variable when creating the model. Using certain parameters, the dataset offers daily bike demands for the American market.


- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The ongoing Corona outbreak has significantly reduced income for BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing startup. This is the business problem that the project is aiming to solve. The company has made the decision to create a comprehensive business plan to grow its income as soon as the ongoing lockdown ends and the economy recovers to a healthy state because it is finding it challenging to thrive in the current market environment. The study aims to understand the public's desire for shared bicycles after the present nationwide quarantine situation connected to Covid-19 expires. The model will aid management in modifying the company's business plan to meet demand and customer expectations.


- What is the dataset that is being used?
The information being used is a huge dataset on daily bike demand throughout the American market based on some characteristics, including weather surveys and people's fashion preferences. A number of independent variables, such as "weathersit," "season," and "yr," as well as the dependent variable "cnt," which reflects the total number of bike rentals, both unregistered and registered ones, are included in the dataset. The goal of the research is to predict demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables in order to pinpoint how demand changes as a result of various features.

## Conclusions
The demand for shared bikes is greatly affected by the season, holidays, weather, humidity, wind speed, and other variables. The model built using multiple linear regression on the test set gets an R-squared score of 0.81, which indicates that it explains 81% of the variance in the target variable.
Management can use the model to evaluate how demand for shared bikes varies with different features and then change the company's business plan to meet demand levels and match customer expectations.
